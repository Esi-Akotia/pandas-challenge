# pandas-challenge

This is the complete Pandas Challenge which includes:
 - the full pynb script with school and district summaries and all grouped summaries
 - the csv files referenced
 - my summary of the analysis & two key insights derived from the data

The starter code shared in the zipped folder was used as guidance, but all other lines of code were written by me and reviewd by my tutor.

Thank you!
